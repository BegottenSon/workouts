Working on figuring it out for tthe day and I figured it out in one day. **finally** I was able to do it
and it didn't take a half a week. I can now take this know how and transfer it to my main website.

[Daniel Brown Codes](https://danielbrown.codes) is getting the *markdown* work up for the blog!

## Next things to do:
- figure how to order by date
- get a template blog post together
- begin posting more to the main website
